### Automating Processes in Git

#### Step 1: Setting up Git Hooks

1. **Create a Pre-Commit Hook Script**

    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to your Git project directory.
    - Create a file named `pre-commit` in `.git/hooks/`.
    - Add the following script to `pre-commit`:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    echo "Running tests..."
    # Command to run tests, for instance:
    # npm test or pytest or other commands

    # If tests fail, halt the commit
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Tests failed, commit aborted!"
        exit 1
    fi
    ```

2. **Allow Execution of the Hook Script**

    - Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
    ```

#### Step 2: Implementing Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions

1. **Set Up GitHub Actions Configuration**

    - Open your GitHub repository.
    - Create a directory named `.github/workflows/` if it doesn’t exist.
    - Create or add a file, for example, `main.yml` in this folder.

    ```yaml
    name: CI

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main
          - master

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v2

          - name: Install dependencies
            run: |
              npm install  # or other package installation command

          - name: Run tests
            run: |
              npm test  # or command to run tests

          # Other steps like build, deploy, etc.
    ```

2. **Commit and Push the Actions Configuration to Your Repository**

    - Commit and push the GitHub Actions configuration file (`main.yml`) to your GitHub repository.

#### Step 3: Automating the Processes

1. **Git Pre-Commit Hook**

    - Every time you commit, Git will execute the pre-commit hook, running tests or other actions you specified.

2. **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**

    - Whenever changes are made to the `main` or `master` branch, GitHub Actions will run.
    - Actions will execute the steps defined in the configuration, such as installing dependencies, running tests, or other deployment steps.

By following these steps, you've automated testing before commits using Git Hooks and established a CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions. Customize the scripts and configurations as per your project’s requirements.
